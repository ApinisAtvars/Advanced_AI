## This is a third semester course that I am following

Each session assignment is included either as a .PDF or .md file in the session folder.

I use a different anaconda environment for each class, and I try my best to remember to export the packages of it in each session folder as a `<ENV_NAME>.yaml` file in a subdirectory called `dependencies`.
